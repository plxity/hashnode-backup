## 6 months Internship experience at InnovAccer 🦄

## Introduction 
Hello Folks,
Hope you all are doing well. 👋

I'm [Apoorv](https://twitter.com/apoorv_taneja). I've recently finished my internship at a unicorn startup [InnovAccer](https://innovaccer.com/) 🦄 .

I have been working with InnovAccer for the past 6 months and it has been a wonderful experience. In this blog, I'll be talking about my experience of working there.

> If you are curious to know how did I get an offer from them, You can check my [previous blog](https://blog.plxity.co/from-getting-an-internship-to-full-time-offer-at-innovaccer). 

As it was a 6 months internship, I'll share my experience in month wise order.


### 1st Month 🙂
My internship started on 17th January 2021. The first week was pretty chill. I got introduced to my team members and the project I'll be working on. I was told to explore the project for some time and check out different features to get an idea of how things are working. Later on, I had to apply for laptop and VPN access but It took some time and I had to wait for almost 20-25 days for the laptop to arrive. 

### 2nd Month 😎
So I got my laptop at the end of the first month and had started working in the last week. This month I was given a few basic tasks to get an understanding of the code so that I become comfortable when bigger tasks or feature requests will be assigned to me in the future. The project was built on ReactJS. I had previous experience of working with it so It was really easy for me to complete all the tasks on time. 

### 3rd Month 🎉
After getting a decent hold on the codebase and coding pattern, I was ready to look after the bigger issues and major feature requests. I worked on integrating some of the features requests which were going to be directly used by Doctors and Hospital staff. I could see my code deployed on the web app which was getting used by a lot of people out there and it made me really happy 🚀.

At the end of the month (which is also a quarter-end) we had a small game evening where we played Poker and had a lot of fun. 🃏

### 4th Month and 5th Month 👨🏻‍💻
These two months, I was moved to a different team. It was a completely new project and I had set up a lot of things from scratch. These 2 months were really hectic as I had to complete the beta version of the application and deploy it before the deadlines. I really enjoyed working in these months and I got to learn a lot of new things about **Video calling, Web Sockets, Cameras and Mic Testing and other things related to video calls.** I was the only Frontend Engineer in this team so It was really a great opportunity for me to build things from scratch and learn a lot. 

### 6th Month 😢(Last month)
In the last month, I was moved back to my previous team as I completed the Project of the previous team on time and successfully deployed it. 🎉
In this month, I continued working on improving and adding new features on the web app for making communication between doctors, hospitals and patients better. 


Today (16th July) was my last day at InnovAccer, I had a small farewell call with all the members of the team. I thanked each and everyone for giving me a chance to work in their team and for helping me to grow as an Engineer. I really liked working with everyone. People were supportive and helpful in my team. 💙

### Ending Note
Overall, it was a really nice experience working there. The culture is really good and the people are very supportive. I would like to thank [Bandana](https://in.linkedin.com/in/bandana-laishram-7733513b), my mentor, who helped me at every step whenever I faced a problem related to Tech or Non-Tech. I wish I get to work with such an amazing team again.

On the note, Thanks for reading my experience. If you get a chance to work at InnovAccer never miss the opportunity 😉
